# 4. except: is a universal exception and will catch all the exceptions.
# 5. The problem with using an empty "except:" is that we won't be able to take measures depending on the exception.
# 6. except IOError will catch Input Output errors.
#    except ZeroDivisionError will catch anytime we will divide by zero.
